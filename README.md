# Taru, an Epitome of Rarity !! ðŸ’Ž

## About
This poem is a heartfelt expression of _apology_ for any mistakes made and admiration for Oindrilla.

## Poem
Iâ€™m sorry for the mistakes I've made,  
If I've caused you trouble, my heart feels weighed,  
Hurting you is the biggest sin I would ever commit,  
Please don't be sad, as it really hit.

I can't bear to see you in pain,  
So I apologize before I recall,  
Hoping you understand my strain.

In this tyrannical world, you are like Cindrella,  
I can't risk making you sad Oindrilla,  
Your messages make me smile everyday,  
Kindly accept my apology, I pray.
